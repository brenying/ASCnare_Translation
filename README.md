# ASCnare Translation Program

## Objective
The purpose of this project was to develop a Java-based text encoding and decoding system that simulates a simple message translation protocol called **ASCnare**. The program allows users to input text, convert each character into its ASCII numeric representation, and reconstruct the original message by decoding those numeric sequences. This project strengthened understanding of input handling, ASCII manipulation, loops, condition checking, and overall Java program structure.

## Skills Learned
- Understanding of ASCII encoding and character-to-integer conversions  
- Proficiency in Java input handling using `Scanner`  
- String manipulation using indexing and substring operations  
- Logic design using loops, switch statements, and exception handling  
- Experience creating menu-driven console applications  
- Debugging and problem-solving skills in Java  

## Tools Used
- Java JDK  
- Terminal/IDE compiler  
- ASCII table references  
- Console-based input/output
